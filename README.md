# Octodroid Build Service
## Description (June 9th, 2022)
This project may be considered like an alternative to a CI setup for [official Octodroid repository](https://github.com/slapperwan/gh4a) and was born because there is no release since [4.6.7](https://github.com/slapperwan/gh4a/releases/tag/4.6.7) which doesn't include a lot of merged PRs. Every time a new PR will be merged in official repository, a new apk will be released in this repository.

## Usage
Go to [releases page](https://github.com/pokemaniac05/OctodroidBuildService/releases/latest) and download latest apk. It is an unofficial debug build and corresponding PRs will be shown in that page.

## Notes
This project isn't affiliated in any way with official Octodroid developers or with GitHub. The rights of Octodroid belong to [Slapperwan](https://github.com/slapperwan) and those of Github belong to Microsoft. This is an unofficial way to get a rolling-release approach for Octodroid.
